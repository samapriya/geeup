It also helps when you have limited upload bandwidth. Cons you have to create a replicate structure of the file system, but it saves on bandwidth and auto-arranges your files so you don't have to look for each additional file.</p> <pre><code>usage: geeup zipshape [-h] --input INPUT --output OUTPUT\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help       show this help message and exit\n\nRequired named arguments.:\n  --input INPUT    Path to the input directory with all shape files\n  --output OUTPUT  Destination folder Full path where shp, shx, prj and dbf\n                   files if present in input will be zipped and stored\n</code></pre> <p>Example setup would be the following</p> <p></p>"}]}
